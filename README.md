## 💻 About the Project

This project consists of a simple home page to promote a fictitious real estate company. The purpose of the project is to serve for didactic purposes, allowing to train front-end web development skills using Bootstrap 5. This project was developed during a youtube tutorial of the channel called ["Matheus Battisti - Hora de Codar"](https://www.youtube.com/c/MatheusBattisti), but with some changes, of course.
